My friend asked me the following question on Google+:
> I'm leading a study on Jonah for my small group. Commentaries point out the dual meaning (one even said "mistranslation") of רעה (at least I think that's it. I call it "house, Y, 7" and yes, I know that would be backwards.) especially in 1:2.

> Since you're the only person I know that knows any Hebrew, I thought it'd be neat to see your thoughts. 

So I translated Jonah 1:2:
> Get up and go to the great city, Nineveh, and proclaim against them\footnote{lit., it. However, it's referring to the people and not the city, the city not being capable of committing sin.} because their wickedness has come up before Me.

and provided the following explanation.

רעה Resh (raysh) ayin (ine) he (hay)

According to the concise Koehler-Baumgartner: "(intended) evil, harm (to someone); wickedness, perverseness; crime; misery, trouble, disaster, evil (in a weakened sense)."

The unabridged Koehler-Baumgartner (the Hebrew-English lexicon) also states: wickedness; wickedness, depravity; midfortune; calamity, disaster

Davidson's Analytical Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon only defines verbs. This word in verb form can either mean to pasture, shepherd, or be a friend to, depending on context.

From my Hebrew professor, Stephen D. Ricks: Ra'ah means sin or wickedness. It is the word which refers to sins that are knowingly committed. This is much different than transgressions (sins that are unknowingly committed) and translated accordingly.

#Conclusion
The context of Jonah is clear in that it refers to sins that are knowingly committed. Exegetically we can say that it refers to sin, not any of the other definitions of the word.﻿
