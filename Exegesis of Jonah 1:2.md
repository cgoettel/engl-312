#Exegesis of Jonah 1:2
##Introduction
Through [my translation of the Old Testament](https://github.com/cgoettel/bible/blob/master/bible.pdf?raw=true) I've noticed areas where the common translations (e.g., King James Version, Darby English, Douay-Rheims, New International Version, etc.) are not always translated the best. In fact, in some instances it seems that things are clearly wrong. [One of the appendices of my Bible](https://github.com/cgoettel/bible/blob/master/Appendix/isaiah.tex) talks about how Isaiah 2:16 is incorrectly translated from the Hebrew by going through multiple, outside sources. This exegesis will be much like the one for Isaiah

##The question
My friend asked the following question on Google+:
> I'm leading a study on Jonah for my small group. Commentaries point out the dual meaning (one even said "mistranslation") of רעה (at least I think that's it. I call it "house, Y, 7" and yes, I know that would be backwards.) especially in 1:2.

> Since you're the only person I know that knows any Hebrew, I thought it'd be neat to see your thoughts. 

So naturally I translated Jonah 1:2 anew:
> Get up and go to the great city, Nineveh, and proclaim against them\footnote{lit., it. However, it's referring to the people and not the city, the city not being capable of committing sin.} because their wickedness has come up before Me.

##Explanation
[רעה](http://www.forvo.com/word/%D7%A8%D7%A2%D7%94/#he) :speaker: (_ra'ah_)

According to the concise Koehler-Baumgartner, _the_ authority on Biblical Hebrew, _ra'ah_ means "(intended) evil, harm (to someone); wickedness, perverseness; crime; misery, trouble, disaster, evil (in a weakened sense)."

The unabridged Koehler-Baumgartner also states: "wickedness; wickedness, depravity; misfortune; calamity, disaster."

Davidson's Analytical Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon only defines verbs which is no good here, _ra'ah_ being an adjective in this context. However, in verb form, _ra'ah_ can either mean "to pasture or shepherd" or "be a friend to," depending on context.

However, the context of Jonah 1:2 makes it clear that we are dealing with an adjective, not a verb. This "dual meaning" or "mistranslation" is simply not warranted because through context we know that we are dealing with _ra'ah_ as an adjective, not a verb. The adjective form, according to Professor Stephen D. Ricks (BYU), means a sin that is knowingly committed. This is much different than transgressions, sins that are unknowingly committed. These words are translated accordingly in most, major translations.

##Conclusion
In this instance we can say that the major translations have indeed translated Jonah 1:2 correctly. The context makes it clear that it refers to sins that are knowingly committed. Exegetically we can say that it refers to sin, not any of the other definitions of the word.

Theologically, there is a growing trend in the world to shy away from calling people out on their sins. The Lord has never worked this way in the scriptures, but is bold in proclaiming people's sins. Such is the case in Jonah 1:2 where Jonah is called to preach against Nineveh's sins. He was not asked to befriend or shepherd them.
