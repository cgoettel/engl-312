What did you learn from the readings about what public discourse should look like in our society? How does this compare with what it actually does look like in the news, politics, or in other public forums? What do you think can be done to bridge the gap?

# RESPONSE
In the business world we are taught that during the brainstorming phases of a project there are no bad ideas. Don't throw anything out no matter how absurd it may seem. This is because the oddest ideas usually turn into the most novel ideas with a little development --- they're usually just one or two steps away from greatness. Public discourse works the same way: don't immediately throw out others' ideas. Listen. Care.

The Anatomy of Peace began with one of the parents saying that their kid was throwing their life away, that they weren't going anywhere. The therapist, however, did not tell them that they were wrong. That they needed to care more, love more. Instead, they listened. This is one of the greatest keys to public discourse: listening. Being open and loving is the best possible way to approach public discourse.

Unfortunately, in the news, politics, and other public forums, people are hasty, quick to judge, unloving, uncaring. The example presented in The Anatomy of Peace, if followed, would greatly benefit public discourse because, as the adage states, people don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. Modern discourse lacks patience and empathy which are essential to change. People are dismissive of others and their beliefs. This behavior alienates newcomers, making them wary to participate.

To better bridge this gap and solve this problem, people need to be held to higher standards. Most everyone is taught as a child to respect others and be nice, but too many people grow up and set these teaching aside as if they are childish things, unwanted in the adult world. However, the true source for peace in public discourse can only come through patience and love.
