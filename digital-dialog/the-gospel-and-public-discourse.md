"The What"

Respond to what arguments these texts make. Consider the following questions:

- What did you learn from "The Mormon Ethic of Civility" and "Truth and Tolerance" about the role of religion in public discourse?

- How do the ideas in these texts relate to what we're doing in English 312? How should/will these ideas affect the way you develop your next argument for this class? The way you give feedback?

"The How"

Respond to how these texts make their arguments. Consider the following questions:

- How does Elder Oaks demonstrate effective argumentative strategies in building his argument?

- What moves do the authors of these texts make to build ethos? How would you describe the ethos built?

- Each of these texts has a different audience: "The Mormon Ethic of Civility" is written for a more general, public audience; "Truth and Tolerance" is geared at LDS young single adults. How do these documents appeal to their specific audiences? Are they effective or ineffective in reaching these audiences?

- How do these texts anticipate potential objections?

Where possible, use examples from the text to support your observations and conclusions, but keep in mind that is an informal assignment and a personal response. Although you should do your best to write clearly, I am most interested in your personal reaction to the texts.

Morality is the basis of civilization. Legislation has always historically been built upon that foundation and it is absurd to think that it would be any different now. The problem most people have is that they have a different view of what is moral, but morals are absolute and defined not by man, but by God.

The central idea of Oaks' discourse is that we should not be hostile in our views and actions towards others; rather, we should be tolerant and willing to listen and help. In like manner, in English 312 we are not supposed to be cantankerous, but understanding and teachable. Humility is the key. The next argument and associated feedback in this class should be formulated with these principles in mind --- be kind, but firm in your position, and help to teach others in such a way that they will not shut off because of your demeanor.

Oaks begins with common ground, relates a story, and delves into his subject. He proceeds to establish a foundation upon which the rest of his argument will be built, builds rapport with his audience through mutual beliefs, and then moves into the more politically and emotionally charged sections with this foundation already lain. Having served as a state judge, Oaks already possesses a great ethos with his audience on this topic because he is professionally qualified to comment on it. His position in the Quorum of the Twelve only helps solidify that position in the minds of Church members. In _The Mormon Ethic of Civility_, ethos is built by quoting prominent leaders in the Church throughout the paper. Because the whole paper is non-confrontational, readers will generally give it credibility because it doesn't upset them.

These approaches to the different audiences is effective because Oaks speaks to matters more closely tied to college aged students, while the other paper is at a higher level of abstraction, thus better suited to a general, world audience.

Both papers handle procatalepsis by teaching principles that can be applied to various arguments, not simply what is stated. This extends the arguments' reach.
